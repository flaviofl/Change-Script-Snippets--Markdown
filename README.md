# Change Script Snippets on Markdown


## Enabling snippets tab-completition
In Visual Studio Code, snippets show in IntelliSense (‚åÉSpace) mixed with other suggestions as well as in a dedicated snippet picker (Insert Snippet in the Command Palette). There is also support for tab-completion: Enable it with `"editor.tabCompletion": "on"`, type a snippet prefix, and press Tab to insert a snippet.
